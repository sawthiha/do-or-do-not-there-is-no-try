The idea is to develop an inference system where the student data are analyzed in terms of imprecision as well as providing consistency through each analysis, accuracy. The problem is that the data itself is irrelevant in terms of noises. Therefore, accuracy is no longer an option if there are no regression. Using the neural network to estimte the relevant data is a feasible solution. And, the inferenecs with imprecision can be achieved by the fuzzy system. Therefore, the proposed system will include two main components, Artificial Neural Network and the fuzzy inference system.
