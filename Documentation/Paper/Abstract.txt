The primary objective of this project is to study the deep neural network and fuzzy inference system to develop an analysis for the student data. It is quite promising that deep learning as an extension will provide accuracy on the inference system. Neural Network is developed from the simple "vanilla" and will be developed iteratively through case studies and well-known heristics. Regularization and first-order optimization methods will be supported. As for fuzzy system, Tagaki-Sugeno method without defuzzification will be implemented.
